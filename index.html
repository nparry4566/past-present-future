<h2>My Past</h2>
<p>
<img class="left"src="images/old_house.jpg" alt="My Old House in RI">
I was born on May 16, 2000 in Washington DC. I lived there for about a year, and then my mom, dad and I moved to Cranston, Rhode Island. I lived in Rhode Island for around ten years and spent most of my childhood there, and it was where my little sister was born. I really loved Rhode Island, but the economic crash in 2008 badly affected <a href="http://rihi.com/">the company my dad worked for<a/>, so we moved to South Carolina because my uncle moved here and said it was nice. I started fifth grade in South Carolina and everything was so different to me than it was in Rhode Island. I eventually got used to it though. </p>

<h2> My Present</h2>
<p>
  <img class="right"src="images/cesa_logo.png" alt="CESA Logo"> <img class="right"src="images/migos_chain.png" alt="Migos Chain">
I now live with my mom, dad, sister, and three dogs. I go to J L Mann High School, and I am in the 11th grade. I like playing on my Xbox, and I also play soccer for <a href="http://www.carolinaelitesc.com/">CESA<a/> and J L Mann. I spend a lot of time with family because my uncle and grandma on my mom's side also live in Greenville, so we like to spend time together. I listen to hip hop music a lot, so I am really interested in it. I get pretty good grades in school, but I don't do too much outside of school besides hanging out with friends, playing soccer, or playing videogames. </p>

<h2> My Future </h2>
<p>
<img class="center"src="images/liverpool_university.jpg" alt="Universtiy of Liverpool Building">
After high school, I hope to college. I'll probably go to an in-state college, but I definitely want to go and study abroad in England at the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/">University of Liverpool<a/>. I would hope to possibly get a soccer scholarship to a school, but it's fine if I don't. As a job, I would still want one that is involved with soccer. I would enjoy being a sports agent or to be in some form of management for a team or company. I would to prefer to move somewhere outside of South Carolina and maybe even the U.S. I just want to be able to live comfortably. My dream would to be to work for my favorite soccer club, Liverpool, in some form. </p>
